# Elder Companion

This app was built to combat loneliness in elderly adults, particularly those living alone. In the first version, an adult can chat with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ChatGPT considers the most beloved president of the Silent Generation. In following iterations, I would be interested to move some of the logic into an AR/VR application, but will get started here. 

Visit [https://elder-companion.com/](https://elder-companion.com/) to see the app. I'll continue to push updates here!

Also, I live tweeted while building this app on the weekend of April 6, 2024. You can find [the thread here](https://twitter.com/chriskeating603/status/1776656778379637243).

If you want to fork this project and run it locally, you can go into your terminal, navigate to a folder you wanna put the project in, and run:
`git clone https://github.com/chriskeating603/elder-companion`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Open a new terminal tab and run 
`cd server`
`node server.js`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
