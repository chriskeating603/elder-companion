# Elder Companion

This app was built to combat loneliness in elderly adults, particularly those living alone. In the first version, an adult can chat with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ChatGPT considers the most beloved president of the Silent Generation. In following iterations, I would be interested to move some of the logic into an AR/VR application, but will get started here. 

If you want to run this project locally, you can run:
 `npm start`
which runs the app in the development mode.\
